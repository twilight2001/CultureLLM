========================

1) DESCRIPTION

This is the README file for OGTD, created for my thesis titled "Detecting Offensive Posts in Greek Social Media".

OGTD contains 4,779 annotated tweets in Greek.

The files included are:
- ogtd-v1.csv: contains the complete collection of tweets

The dataset was annotated using a team of three volunteer annotators. The gold labels were assigned taking the agreement of the annotators into consideration. 

Twitter user mentions were substituted by @USER and URLs have been erased.

OGTD is annotated using binary labels. Each instance contains one label.

2) FORMAT

The column names of the dataset are the following:

ID	Tweet	Label

3) LABELS AND ANNOTATION

The labels for offensive language identification in Greek are:

- Offensive - Profane or obscene posts with an offensive connotation or if it can be considered offensive based on the context, in any way for the target/targets of the tweet and not only the annotators themselves.
- Not Offensive - Clean posts that do fall into the above description.
