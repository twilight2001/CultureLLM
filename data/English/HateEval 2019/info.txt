File format

The data have been encoded with the same format, independently of the task and language. Such format consists of a tab-separated file with one line per tweet containing the following fields:

    a numeric ID that uniquely identifies the tweet within the dataset (id column)
    the text of the tweet (text column)
    a binary value {1|0} indicating if hate speech is occurring against one of the given targets, women or immigrants (HS column)
    if HS occurs (i.e. the value for the feature at point 2 is 1), a binary value indicating if the target is a generic group of people (0) or a specific individual (1) (TR column)
    if HS occurs (i.e. the value for the feature at point 2 is 1), a binary value indicating if the tweeter is aggressive (1) or not (0) (AG column)
